Machine learning operations (MLOps) are a set of practices that automate and simplify machine learning (ML) workflows and deployments. Machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) are core capabilities that you can implement to solve complex real-world problems and deliver value to your customers. MLOps is an ML culture and practice that unifies ML application development (Dev) with ML system deployment and operations (Ops). Your organization can use MLOps to automate and standardize processes across the ML lifecycle. These processes include model development, testing, integration, release, and infrastructure management.

This process involves tracking changes in the machine learning assets so you can reproduce results and roll back to previous versions if necessary. Every ML training code or model specification goes through a code review phase. Each is versioned to make the training of ML models reproducible and auditable.

Reproducibility in an ML workflow is important at every phase, from data processing to ML model deployment. It means that each phase should produce identical results given the same input
